                    <p>Hi there, I'm Roshan Arokiaraj. I'm a 2nd Year CS Major in Info/Intel threads. I was born
                        and raised in California, but moved to Virginia in 10th grade where I now live.
                        I'm super passionate about advocating for public policy and spreading awareness about
                        our climate. Something neat about me is that I play both the piano and the saxophone and 
                        have composed music and arrangements for both before. 
                    </p>
